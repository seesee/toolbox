# CC's Toolbox
A toolbox containing handy scripts/apps/pages/utils etc.

## Web Apps
All webapps are self-contained and run in-browser using local storage. No
tracking or other nonsense is included. Everything is 100% private and 
completely offline.

### Activity Tracker
[Activity Tracker](https://seesee.github.io/toolbox/webapps/activity_tracker.html) 
is a (mostly) single page web app that allows you to track what you're doing 
throughout the day.

### Templatimator
[Templatimator](https://seesee.github.io/toolbox/webapps/templatimator.html)
is a quick way of taking a text outline, applying a bunch of variables to it
and outputting as text/html/csv etc.
